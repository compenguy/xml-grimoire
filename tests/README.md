# Tests

## Conformance

Tests in the "`xmltests/`" subdirectory are W3C conformance test documents from the "`xmltests` subdirectory of the [Test Archive](https://www.w3.org/XML/Test/xmlts20020606.tar), described on the [Conformance Test Suite page](https://www.w3.org/XML/Test/xmlconf-20020606.htm).

Note that these tests are under copyright terms that require that they be distributed in the same form as they appear in [xmltest.zip](ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/xmltest.zip).  I have adhered to these requirements in reproducing that collection here, to the best of my knowledge.

## 
Tests in the "`valid/`" subdirectory contain conformant documents that should pass parsing.
